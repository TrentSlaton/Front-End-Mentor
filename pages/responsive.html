    <h1>Responsive</h1>
    <p>Showcase items tagged with the <code>responsive</code> tag are projects that are optimized for responsiveness. Responsiveness means graceful layouts at all reasonable screen dimensions. Unless otherwise stated, all code is written by hand by me in plain HTML, CSS, or JavaScript... i.e. no templating, frameworks, libraries or build tools.</p>
