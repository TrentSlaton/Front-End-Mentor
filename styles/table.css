So it would seem that display: table-cell and float cause the content to be filled out differently. Also, I had to specifically select the <p> tag in float.css since it was applying margin-bottom to every <p> tag, not just the direct child of .summary_section like it was doing in table.css... I think it has to do with the fact that .price_section is a display: table-cell... */
