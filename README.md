# [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a platform for improving your front-end skills by building real projects.

## Solve real-world HTML, CSS and JavaScript challenges whilst working to professional designs.

**How it works**: The user is given a challenge to solve. Each challenge comes with relevant image assets, a style guide and a mockup of the intended design. The user is expected to recreate the design within the given constraints. The user may use any technologies they wish... React, Angular, Bootstrap, Tailwind...

**_All of my challenges are completed with plain vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript and are all written by hand. Only a text editor is used._**

Here is a live demo of this repository: [link](https://trentslaton.github.io/Front-End-Mentor/)

This is a combined repository for all of my http://frontendmentor.io challenges. It is a continual work in progress.
