# TODO

set up github project page

describe goals and motivations (layout methods)

describe challenges... BIG CHALLENGE: the use of position on the overlay made things very difficult... impossible? table and grid seemed to handle it the best, but float and position are completely scuffed.

screenshots

blurb (capabilities/limitations of each layout as it relates to this project in particular)

implement way to dynamically swap layouts

implement a little question mark tooltip for the challenging points for each layout
