# Front-End-Mentor

##Front End Mentor is a platform for improving your front-end skills by building real projects. Solve real-world HTML, CSS and JavaScript challenges whilst working to professional designs.

The user is given a challenge to solve. Each challenge comes with relevant image assets, a style guide, and a mockup of the intended design. The user is expected to recreate the design within the given constraints. The user may use any technologies they wish... React, Angular, Bootstrap, Tailwind...

***All of my challenges are completed with plain vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript and are all written by hand. Only a text editor is used.***
