challenge: [link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-)

_A very simple yet elegant three-column layout. The elegance is in the use of the inherent block-layout properties of the HTML elements. All that is needed is to define each column, and the rest flows into place. Responds to changes in viewport size and demonstrates buttons that change styling on hover._

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Implement dynamic layout switcher with blurbs explaining dynamics of each layout technique.
