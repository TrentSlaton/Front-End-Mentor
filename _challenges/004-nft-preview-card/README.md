_A simple single-column layout featuring a one-of-a-kind NFT... dont miss out!_

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Implement dynamic layout switcher with blurbs explaining dynamics of each layout technique.
