_A simple two-column layout displaying what appears to be the results of a mental acuity assessment. The results card is centered in the viewport and transitions to a vertical layout at smaller viewport sizes. Features a button that changes style on hover._

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Implement dynamic layout switcher with blurbs explaining dynamics of each layout technique.
