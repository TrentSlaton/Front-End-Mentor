_A product feature page for what appears to be an AI-powered SaaS. The product features are laid out in cards in a stylized cross formation._

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Implement dynamic layout switcher with blurbs explaining dynamics of each layout technique.
