challenge: [link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa)

_A simple two-column layout featuring the image of a perfume bottle and its product details. The product card is centered in the viewport and transitions to a vertical layout at smaller viewport sizes. The image elegantly responds to both horizontal and vertical viewport adjustment. Features a button that changes style on hover._

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Implement dynamic layout switcher with blurbs explaining dynamics of each layout technique.
