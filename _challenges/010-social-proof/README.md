_A social-proof page for what seems to be a fantastic product! Star ratings and customer reviews are laid out in a staggered progression._

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Multi-layout. Mobile. Make it great.
