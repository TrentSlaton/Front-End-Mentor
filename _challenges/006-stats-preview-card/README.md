_A two-column layout featuring the faces of our very happy customers... and the stats that make them happy! The image responds gracefully to both horizontal and vertical changes in viewport size. The image also has a deep purple tint in the form of a transparent overlay._

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Implement dynamic layout switcher with blurbs explaining dynamics of each layout technique.
