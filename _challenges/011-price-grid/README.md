_A three-section grid layout advertising a community around the product and the price and benefits of the product. Demonstrates a button that changes style on hover._

This challenge implements several layout methods: table, float, position, flexbox and grid. The purpose was to familiarize myself with these techniques in order to gain a better understanding of which methods would be better or worse in a given scenario. Learning alternative and legacy layout methods is also useful when maintaining legacy webpages.

# TODO

Implement dynamic layout switcher with blurbs explaining dynamics of each layout technique. Clean it up, make it great.
